# What is Earmuff.me?

Earmuff.me is a social network to keep track of what tv episode you're currently on amongst a group.  Quickly check the status of your group so you know what you can and can't talk about.  It's all about not spoiling what's happening on GoT or True Detective if you have a straggler in the group.  Spoilers are bad, so don't be that person in your group of friends.
